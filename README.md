# Homework Week 2

## Bash command 1:

\*cd

cd's full name is choose directory and it is the most common bash command we use. It's like sugar and salt, it's not breathtakingly amazing, but we need them almost everyday.

## Bash command 2:

\*mkdir

mkdir's full name is make directory. Sometimes you will find it's easier to type mkdir than making a mouse click to create a new one!

## Bash command 3:

\*rm -rf

This is a dangerous yet handy command. Unless 100% sure, don't use it easily. Otherwise it will delete all your files without even prompting you!
